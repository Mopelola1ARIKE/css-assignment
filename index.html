            <p>Change the page size by typing in new values for width and height. Page size 
                represents the final size you want after bleeds or trimming other marks outside the page. 
                In the Preset dropdown menu you can find such common sizes as letter, legal, tabloid, 
                etc. Typing in exact values for Height and Width gives you more control over the size 
                and orientation of your page. 
                Resolution 
                Resolution is a number of pixels on a printed area of an image. The higher the 
                resolution, the more pixels there are on the page, the better is the quality of the image. 
                However, high resolution increases the size of the file. The standard recommended 
                resolution for printed images is 150 - 300, for Web images - 72. </p>
